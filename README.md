**Sovereign On-Premise Agentic AI Workbench using Open-Weight Multimodal LLMs
for Confidential Industrial Work**

---

An agentic AI workbench that runs entirely inside a plant's own network. No
data leaves the facility. Two working scenarios:

1. **Scanned report → approval note** — OCR a scanned inspection report, ground
   the reading in MRPL's own SOPs, extract engineering findings, generate a real
   `.docx` approval note.
2. **Coding task → verified code** — generate Python for a plain-English
   request, then *execute it in an isolated sandbox* to verify it actually runs
   before returning it.

Every step is written to an append-only audit log.

---

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
pytest -v
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.

Works immediately in **stub mode** with no model installed. To use real local
models, see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) step 8.

## The two flags that matter

In `.env`:

```
USE_REAL_MODEL=false     # true = real llama.cpp models, false = deterministic stub
USE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE=true  # RAG grounding on MRPL reference docs
```

`USE_REAL_MODEL=false` is the **demo safety net**. If the models misbehave
before recording, flip it and everything still works. Real model calls also fall
back to the stub automatically if a server is unreachable — no single failure
can take down the demo.

---

## Before you push

```bash
pytest -v
```

Green, always. See [docs/TEAM_TRACKS.md](docs/TEAM_TRACKS.md) for branch naming
and the cross-platform rules.


## Security & Authentication
Role-based authentication is fully implemented. A custom login UI securely manages sessions, requiring Email, GitHub ID, or Phone Number along with a hashed password. User data and session management is handled via an encrypted JSON database (users.json), ensuring users only access their own private chat histories.

## Updates:
- **Profile Editing:** Logged-in users can update their Name, Profession, and Country via the Edit Profile button in the sidebar.
- **Animated UI:** Added 3D perspective animations and glowing effects to the authentication container.
- **Validation:** Enforces 6-character passwords and strictly 6-digit Employee Codes during registration.
- **Git Safety:** Explicitly ensured users.json is ignored via .gitignore to prevent leaking hashed passwords or PII.
